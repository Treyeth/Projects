# Analysis and forecast of stock indices using RNNs

The scope of this project is to analyse and to forecast the trend of Dow Jones Industrial Average, SMI, BEL 20 and BET stock market indices. The chosen period for this analysis is 01.02.2012-31.01.2020. In this project 2 types of models are used, LSTM and GRU. 

These models have the ability to take into account long-term dependencies, which make them adequate for time sequence modelling. The training set contains data from 01.02.2012 until 31.12.2018 and the train set from 01.01.2019 up until 31.01.2020. The dinamic forecasts use sequences with updated after 15 days forecasted. In order to observe the accuracy, the forecasts are compared with the real values in the testing set. 

## Intro

For the analysis, the stock closing prices are taken from Investing and afterwards are transformed in yields in order to have the same scale for all the stock indices. Having the same scale can help us identify easier the outliers and to make comparisons between the indices. 

For the estimation of the LSTM and GRU models and for the trend forecast the closing prices are normalised. Exploring a multitude of values for the hyperparameters, the best LSTM model and the best GRU model are determined based on their mean squared error (MSE). 

The sequences contain 60 observations and the forecasts are generated on time period of 15 days until the sequence update and the generation of a new forecast. In this paper, it is also searched if the best forecasts are generated by the model with lowest MSE. 

Dow Jones Industrial Average, also known as Dow or Dow Jones is a stock index which measures the performance of 30 big companies listed on the stock market from USA. In these 30 companies we can find names like Apple, IBM, Boeing, Microsoft, Mc Donald's and Coca-Cola.

BET, or Bucharest Exchange Trading Index, is the first stock index created by the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BVB) and includes the 10 most liquid companies listed on BVB. Names likes Banca Transilvania, DIGI, MedLife, OMV Petrom and BRD can be found in it.

SMI, Swiss Market Index, is the most followed stock index from Switzerland. It contains the 20 biggest and liquid companies from Swiss Performance Index. Here, we can find names like Swatch and Nestlé.

BEL 20 is the reference index from Euronext Brussels, composed by between 10 and 20 companies listed on the stock exchange from Brussels.

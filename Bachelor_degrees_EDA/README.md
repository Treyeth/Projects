The scope of this project is to analyze the evolution of bachelor degrees gained by woman over time. The analysed period takes place between 1970 and 2012. 17 majors are disponible for our project : Agriculture, Architecture, Art and Performance, Biology, Business, Communications and Journalism, Computer Science, Education, Engineering, English, Foreign Language, Health Professions, Math and Statistics, Physical Sciences, Psychology, Public Administration and Social Sciences and History.

The data was made publicly available by The Department of Education Statistics which releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women. The data is available on Randon Olson's website [here](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv).

Key takeouts from the evolution seen above:

* Psychology and Communications and Journalism majors are overwhelmingly women nowadays compared to the 1970's.

* Health, Foreign Languages, Public Administration and Education was favorited by women and it still is today.

* The most favorited majors of men are Computer Science and Engineering. 

* Biology has more women majors in recent years than men.

* Following the evolution of the Agriculture majors, we could expect more women majors than men in the next years.

* Social Sciences and Business seems to be the field where men and women tend to have a ratio of 1:1.

* Architecture registered a big growth in women degrees but seems to have stagnated in the last years leaving it still to be a men preferred field.

<h4> Hi! </h4>

I'm Cristian, a graduate student of Quantitative Economics passionate about data science and analytics. My journey into the field started 4 years ago while being an undergraduate our Microeconomics teacher presented us ways that we can manipulate, extract information from data and visualize it. These things have really caught my attention back then and I have started to learn everything I could about the field. This led firstly to Datacamp which provided me with some basics and afterwards to a Bachelor thesis on time series analysis on the volatility of stock with ARMA-GARCH models. Enjoying working with data, I have decided to continue my studies in Cybernetics and Quantitative Economics in order to learn more. I have met a lot of people who loved data and have helped me learn a lot in this time. This time around my Master's thesis was based on evaluating recurrent neural networks (RNNs) performance when applied on stable and unstable stock indices from all around the globe. For both of my theses, I was awarded with the highest grade.

Please find below the aforementioned projects:

Project 1. [Analysis and Forecast of Stock Indices using RNNs](https://github.com/Treyeth/Projects/tree/master/Analysis_Forecast_Indices_RNN)

Project 2. [Volatility forecast of Stock Indices using ARMA-GARCH models](https://github.com/Treyeth/Projects/tree/master/Volatility_Forecast_Stock)

I'm a firm believer that we can get a better perspective of our world and change a lot of things by using data.

<h4> Hi and welcome to my projects page! </h4>

I'm Cristian, a graduate student of Quantitative Economics passionate about data science and analytics. My journey into the field in 2017 when, while being an undergraduate, our Microeconomics teacher presented us the ways in which we can manipulate and extract information from data and afterwards visualize it. These things have really caught my attention back then and I have started to learn everything I could about the field. This led firstly to a tutorial based website, Datacamp, which provided me with some basics. Afterwards, I concluded my Undergrade studies with a Bachelor thesis on time series analysis on the volatility of stock with ARMA-GARCH models. Enjoying working with data, I have decided to continue my studies in Cybernetics and Quantitative Economics in order to learn more. I have met a lot of people who loved data and have helped me to learn a lot in this 2 years. This time around my Master's thesis was based on evaluating recurrent neural networks (RNNs) performance when applied on stable and unstable stock indices from all around the globe. For both of my theses, I was awarded with the highest mark.

Please find below the aforementioned projects:

Project 1. R. [Analysis and Forecast of Stock Indices using RNNs](https://github.com/Treyeth/Projects/tree/master/Analysis_Forecast_Indices_RNN) 

Project 2. Python. [Volatility forecast of Stock Indices using ARMA-GARCH models](https://github.com/Treyeth/Projects/tree/master/Volatility_Forecast_Stock)

While doing my masters, I also started to work as a Data Analytics Specialist, which lasted for 2.5 years. The workplace helped me improve my R, Excel and SPSS skills. Currently, I'm working as a Data Governance Analyst, improving my Python and SQL skills.

Additional side projects;

Project 3. Excel. [Budgeting tracker](https://github.com/Treyeth/Projects/tree/master/Budgeting)

Project 4. Excel. [Productivity tracker](https://github.com/Treyeth/Projects/tree/master/Productivity_Tracker)

Project 5. Python. [Bachelor Degrees EDA](https://github.com/Treyeth/Projects/tree/master/Bachelor_degrees_EDA)

Project 6. Python. [EDA_Employee_Exit_Surveys](https://github.com/Treyeth/Projects/tree/master/EDA_Employee_Exit_Surveys)

I'm a firm believer that we can get a better perspective of our world and change a lot of things by using data.
